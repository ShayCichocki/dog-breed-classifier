# Dog Breed classifier
This project was created for the Deep Learning NanoDegree program for Udacity

Its purpose was to teach CNNs. 

The final solution was created using a pre trained inception_13 net with the last layer replaced to match the new outputs

This solution achieved ~75% accuracy on identifying dog breeds
